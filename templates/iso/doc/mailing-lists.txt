                  Introduction to the Debian mailing lists
                  ========================================

  Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all
  around the world. Therefore, email is the preferred way to discuss
  various items. Much of the conversation between Debian developers
  and users is managed through several mailing lists.  

  There are many world-open mailing lists, meaning anyone can read
  everything that is posted, and participate in the discussions. Everyone is
  encouraged to help development of Debian and to spread the word of free
  software.  There are also a few lists which are only open to official Debian
  developers; please don't interpret this as closed development, it sometimes
  doesn't make much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

  All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server, using an
  automatic mail processing software called SmartList.  This server is called
  lists.debian.org.  All submission, subscription and unsubscription messages
  have to be sent to a particular address at this host.

  The language used on all lists is English, unless stated otherwise.
  There are some user lists for other languages available.

Subscription / Unsubscription
-----------------------------

  Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
  presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open'.

  The requests for subscription or unsubscription can be sent to a special
  control address, which is slightly different from the list address.
  Subscription or unsubscription messages should NOT be sent to the address
  of the mailing list itself.

  To subscribe or unsubscribe from a mailing list, please send mail to

        <listname>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

  with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.

  Please remember the -REQUEST part of the address.

  As part of the subscription process, the list software will send you an
  email to which you must reply in order to finish subscribing.  This is a
  security measure to keep people from subscribing others to the lists without
  their permission.

  If you need to contact a human listmaster, direct your mail to
  listmaster@lists.debian.org . To find out who is responsible for the
  lists, take a look at http://www.debian.org/intro/organization

Debian mailing list advertising policy
--------------------------------------

  This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".

  The Debian mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment. The fee
  for advertisments is a donation of USD 1000 or more to "Software in the
  Public Interest" (SPI).  One donation per advertisement, please.  If you
  prefer to pay in arrears, simply post your advertisement to the list, and
  the list operator will bill you USD 1999.  The list operator will donate
  this amount, minus the expense of collecting it, to SPI.  Please note that
  the lists are distributed automatically -- messages are generally not read
  or checked in any way before they are distributed.

  The act of posting an advertisement indicates your willingness to
    * accept responsibility for the fee,
    * indemnify the list operator against any legal claims from you or
        others in connection with your advertisement, and
    * pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
  Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your
  message.

  Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
  advertisements. You must consult the list operator in advance of posting for
  any reduction or fee waiver.
